.SH NAME
Hammer \- a bit oriented parsing library
.SH SYNOPSIS
#include <hammer\/hammer.h>
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Hammer
is a parsing library. Like many modern parsing libraries, it provides a parser combinator interface for writing grammars as inline domain-specific languages, but Hammer also provides a variety of parsing backends. It's also bit-oriented rather than character-oriented, making it ideal for parsing binary data such as images, network packets, audio, and executables.

Hammer is written in C and provides a packrat parsing backend.

Hammer currently builds under Linux, OS X, and Windows.
.SH NOTES
Bit-oriented -- grammars can include single-bit flags or multi-bit constructs that span character boundaries, with no hassle

Thread-safe, reentrant

Benchmarking for parsing backends -- determine empirically which backend will be most time-efficient for your grammar

    Parsing backends:
        Packrat parsing
.SH EXAMPLE
.nf
 1  #include <hammer/hammer.h>
 2  #include <stdio.h>
 3
 4  int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
 5      uint8_t input[1024];
 6      size_t inputsize;
 7
 8      HParser *hello_parser = h_token("Hello World", 11);
 9
10      inputsize = fread(input, 1, sizeof(input), stdin);
11
12      HParseResult *result = h_parse(hello_parser, input, inputsize);
13      if(result) {
14          printf("yay!\n");
15      } else {
16          printf("boo!\n");
17      }
18  }
